## Adversarial attacks

### Imagenet dataset
* The adversarial patch uses samples from the validation set of Imagenet, which contains 50000 samples
* Can be downloaded from the official imagenet website under the `ILSVRC2012` validation set
  * The labels in the development kit are of type `ILSVRC2012_ID`, whereas the labels predicted by the pretrained `resnet50` are based on an alphabetical sort of the synset labels.
